# Yggdrasil — a living tree of the plant kingdom

An interactive taxonomic tree of every family of land plant, from mosses to
orchids, down to ~14,000 genera. Nodes are **sized by species richness** and
**coloured by lineage**; the tree opens collapsed at order level and expands to
families and genera on click, with tree · radial · sunburst · treemap views, a
geological time scrubber, and a distribution map.

`plant-tree.html` is a single self-contained page — no runtime dependencies and
no network calls, so it runs from a `file://` URL in any browser. See
[ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for how it's authored and how it renders.

## Data

611 taxa arranged `Plantae → clades → orders → families`. Vascular plants are
resolved to **family** (~479 families); bryophytes stop at **class**. The data is
stored **flat** — one record per taxon, keyed by a stable `id` with a `parent`
pointer — which is joinable, validatable, and diff-friendly. `build.py` derives
the nested tree the visualization consumes.

Each record:

```jsonc
{
  "id": "Fabaceae",                // stable key (currently the name; unique)
  "parent": "Fabales",             // parent id; null for the root
  "rank": "family",                // kingdom|clade|phylum|class|subclass|order|family|subfamily|genus
  "name": "Fabaceae",
  "common": "Legumes — beans, peas, acacia, clover",  // optional
  "speciesCount": 19500,           // accepted-species richness (for scaling)
  "examples": ["Phaseolus (bean)", "Pisum (pea)", "Acacia", "Trifolium (clover)"],
  "blurb": "Legume family: nitrogen-fixing plants bearing pod fruits …",
  "ids": { "gbif": 5386 },         // external identifiers (see fetch.py)
  "provenance": { "speciesCount": "estimate" }        // per-field source
}
```

Sources: **APG IV** (angiosperm orders & families), **PPG I** (lycophytes &
ferns), and standard gymnosperm/bryophyte treatments for the topology; **GBIF
Backbone** for identifiers; **Kew WCVP** for accepted-species counts. Counts
carrying `provenance: estimate` are approximate and await a sourced value —
`fetch.py` and a WCVP snapshot replace them (see below).

## Build & enrich

```sh
python3 build/build.py     # validate taxa.json → derive tree → plant-tree.html
python3 build/fetch.py     # (with internet) fill GBIF ids + metrics into taxa.json
python3 build/wcvp.py      # apply Kew WCVP accepted-species counts (needs the dump)
python3 build/ages.py      # derive divergence ages from a dated megatree
```

`fetch.py` is idempotent and throttled. It writes GBIF `usageKey`s (identifiers +
deep links) and GBIF species counts (stored separately as `gbifSpeciesCount`,
since the backbone count includes synonyms and is *not* the accepted-species
display number).

`wcvp.py` sets the honest `speciesCount` (accepted species only) and native
`dist`ribution from Kew's [WCVP](https://sftp.kew.org/pub/data-repositories/WCVP/).
WCVP is a bulk download (~440 MB), not an API: unzip it into `data/wcvp/`
(git-ignored) and run the script. Families WCVP circumscribes differently
(e.g. Adoxaceae → Viburnaceae, some fern families) keep their estimate.

`ages.py` derives a divergence `ageMy` for each clade from the dated
[plant megatree](https://github.com/megatrees/plant_20221117) (Jin & Qian 2022;
Smith & Brown 2018; Zanne 2014) — a single 2.9 MB Newick it reads from
`data/megatree/` (git-ignored). Crown age via the MRCA of a clade's tips, with
light outlier rejection to reject the occasional misplaced genus; monotypic
lineages get a stem age. Vascular plants only, so bryophytes stay undated.

Edit the data in `data/taxa.json` or the presentation in `build/src/` (the
stylesheet and the JS modules), then rebuild.

## Develop & test

```sh
make            # list targets
make build      # rebuild plant-tree.html from build/src + data
make test       # build, then run the headless-Chrome regression suite
make serve      # build + serve the repo at http://localhost:8000
```

`test/smoke.mjs` boots headless Chrome against the built page and asserts the
invariants — data integrity, all four views, the core interactions, viewport
virtualization, and reduced-motion — with no npm dependencies. See
[ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for the source layout and the render model.

## Design system

The UI is a small CSS-class design system — tokens in `design/tokens.css`,
components (`.ctl`, `.seg`, `.menu`, chips, `.search`, `.tip`, `.panel`) in
`build/src/app.css` — documented in a Storybook workshop that imports the *same*
files the app build uses, so it can never drift from the shipped page. It's
dev-only; the app itself keeps zero runtime dependencies.

```sh
npm install            # one-time (dev-only Storybook toolchain)
make storybook         # workshop at http://localhost:6006
make storybook-build   # static site → storybook-static/
```

## Controls

Drag to pan, scroll or pinch to zoom. **Click** a node to open its detail panel
(blurb, example genera, stats, clickable lineage breadcrumb) and expand it.
**Search** jumps to a family; **hover** traces a lineage back to the root.
**Highlight** chips light up curated sets — carnivores, crops, biggest families —
and list them for exploring. Keyboard: arrow keys traverse, Enter expands.

Links are shareable: opening a node writes `#sel=<family>` to the URL, so
`…/plant-tree.html#sel=Orchidaceae` opens straight to that family.
